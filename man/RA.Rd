\title{Relative Amplitude}
\usage{
RA(x, window = 1, method = c("average", "sum"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{vector} vector of activity data}

\item{window}{since the calculation of M10 and L5 depends on the dimension of data, we need to include
window size as an argument.}

\item{method}{\code{character} of "sum" or "average", function used to bin the data}
}
\value{
RA
}
\description{
This function calculate relative amplitude, a nonparametric metric
representing fragmentation of circadian rhythmicity
}
\examples{
data(example_activity_data)
count1 = c(t(example_activity_data$count[1,-c(1,2)]))
ra = RA(x = count1, window = 10, method = "average")
